Productivity Owl - v2.0.3
- There was a respect calculation problem.  Also working on integrations, multiple task lists, but they are not ready yet

Productivity Owl - v2.0
=============================================================================
Thanks to everyone who has used the owl over the last 8 years.  Version 1.X focused on making better web browsing habits.  Version 2 has a larger goal.
I want the Productivity Owl to be a complete solution to increase productivity, stop procrastination, and motivate you to achieve your goals.

I've made the extension open-source under the Apache 2.0 license so everyone can trust the owl.  Your data is never sent anywhere.  
Everything is stored locally on your computer.   

There are a lot of other updates in this release:
- Tasks/Rewards system to earn break time (to take a break after completing tasks click the extension icon, then click take a break)
- Owl Interventions (excercises to help motivate, and understand why you might be procrastinating)
- Earning Owl's Respect is now possible... but unlikely 
- Browsing Stats, and ability to set time limits on certain websites even if it's break time
- Time Boxing, to help you declare what your schedule will be.  If you set a time for work the owl becomes slightly more strict and doesn't allow removing block sites, and a couple other things

Productivity Owl - v1.0 - v1.3  (2012 - 2020)
=============================================================================
The Productivity Owl will eliminate your time wasting habits on the internet.  

Instead of just blacklisting certain websites, the productivity owl is present on every page.  

He allows a certain amount of time to get the info you need, then get out.  This creates a system where you learn to find what you need fast.  If you don't go fast to beat the owl's timer, the owl will close the page's tab for you.  

Of course work-related websites (and search engine pages) can be given a free pass.  On these pages, you will have all the time you need. Just set those websites as "Allowed Websites" in the options.  

Certain sites such as Facebook and Youtube should be set as "Blocked Websites" in the options. 

You must plan all your breaks in advance with the "Freetime Scheduler." During "Freetime" the owl will not close your tabs.

*** WARNING: This extension is very annoying.  The owl is constantly flying across your pages, annoying you, and closing your tabs.  If you are not serious about being productive, this extension may not be for you.***
